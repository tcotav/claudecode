description: Using the showboat tool, create a linear walkthrough of the code
---

Read the source and then plan a linear walkthrough of the code that explains how it all works in detail

- Then run “showboat –help” to learn showboat

- if showboat isn't installed, it can be installed with the command "uv tool install showboat"

- use showboat to create a walkthrough.md file in the repo and build the walkthrough in there, using showboat note for commentary and showboat exec plus sed or grep or cat or whatever you need to include snippets of code you are talking about

- create mermaid diagrams if the project is complex
